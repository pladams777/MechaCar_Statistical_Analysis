# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
The purpose of this project is to help AutosRUsâ€™ upper management to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team. They need to understand why the newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles which are blocking their progress.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

The first task in the project is to perform a multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes.

![D1]()

** Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
	** The two variables that provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset were vehicle_length and ground_clearance.

** Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
	** No the slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because the p-value is 5.35e-11 which is less than the assumed significance level of 0.05%.

** Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
	** Yes the linear model did predict the mpg effectivly because its r squared value is greater that 70%.
